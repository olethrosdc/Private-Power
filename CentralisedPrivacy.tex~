\title{The Price of Privacy in Real-time Electricity Markets}

\author{Christos Dimitrakakis \and Maryam Kar}
\maketitle

\section{Introduction.}
\label{sec:introduction}
We consider the problem of privacy for households participating in
smart grid system. From the point of view of the households, there are
two distinct problems: firstly, how much privacy do they lose in
general by participating in an online price mechanism? Secondly, given
that they participate in the mechanism, how much privacy can they
expect with respect to their household occupancy?

Here we analyse both a Cournot and a Bertrand pricing model for
electricity markets from the point of view of achieving consumer
privacy. This requires us to deviate slightly fro the equilibrium
prices in order to protect sensitive information.

\subsection{A Bertrand model for electricity demand pricing}
\label{sec:bertr-model-electr}
Here we have an actual demand function $\demand(\price)$ at a given
price level $\price$. We must differentiate between posted demand
$\ask_t$ and the actual demand $\demand_t$, as the price $\price_t$ is
determined by the posted demand, and later households decide how much
to actually consume based on the posted price. Finally, we define a
utility function for the posted price level, in order to measure our
loss due to deviation from equilibrium.
\begin{align}
  \demand_t &= \demand(\price_t, \ask_t) =  \ask_t - \elas \price_t \tag{demand function}\\
  \util(\price_t)
            &= (\price_t - \cost) [\demand(\price_t) + \fdemand_t]
              =  (\price_t - \cost) (\ask_t - \elas \price_t + \fdemand_t).
              \tag{utility}
\end{align}
\maryam{who's utility function is this? Why the utility is not $\price_t$ times the actual demand? it seems to me demand should follow the price, not price following the demand! :) }
\christos{Replying in the actual text below:}
Here, players post a planned demand $\demand_t = (\demand_t^i)_{i=1}^n$ corresponding to their type. Then the provider selects a price level $\price_t$, taking into account the fact that the actual demand $\demand_t$ of the players is going to depend on the price and their asked demand through the elasticity $\elas$. The provider's utility is simply the profit per unit of electricity sold, times the total demand of electricity, with $\cost$ being the fixed unit cost of production.
 \maryam{What is the interpretation of the "\cost"
  here?}\footnote{Note that in the previous model, demand seemed to
  increase with price, but the causation is inverse, it's just that
  the intercept of the two lines moves in this way: when there is more
  demand there are more buyers willing to pay the higher price. In our
  setting, the market may not clear.} 
Within this model, the optimal
price level is
\[
\price^*_t = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\ask_t + \fdemand_t}{\elas} + \cost\right),
\]
which intuitively represents a price level halfway between the cost of the electricity production and the satisfiable demand with the given elasticity. 
\maryam{Ok, but this is the same price function we had before..just relabeling of the constants.  }
\christos{Yeah, we get the same linear price structure, but there is a separation between planned demand and actual demand. I guess that at equilibrium, the planned and actual demand are the same. However, but I think the Bertrand model gives a slightly different Nash equilibrium.}
As the price signal is public, it is possible that the electricity provider leaks information about individual consumption. For that reason, we consider differentially private pricing mechanisms.

\subsection{Privacy model.}
\label{sec:privacy-model}
Consider a mechanism like the above that, given the demanded consumption
$\demand_t^i$ of households $i$ at times $t$, decides upon a price
level $\price_{t}$ for that time period, which depends on
$\demand_{t}$. As the mechanism's price level is public knowledge, it
can leak private information about demand (or consumption). For that
reason, we shall consider price-setting algorithms that have privacy
guarantees.

\paragraph{Planned consumption privacy.} If the mechanism for determining the price level is
$\epsilon$-differentially private for period $t$, the we must have
\[
\left|
  \ln \frac{\Pr(\price_t \mid \ask_t)}{\Pr(\price_t \mid \ask'_t)}
\right|
 \leq \epsilon
\]
where $\ask_t = (\ask^1_t, \ldots, \ask^n_t)$ is a vector of bids
and/or consumptions of individual households for the $t$-th time
period and $\ask'_t$ is a vector where the data of one individual is
added or missing.  However this only protects us against one time
period: for $T$ periods, this only guarantees $T \epsilon$
differential privacy.

\paragraph{Demand privacy.} If there is no public signal associated
with demand, then we need not consider privacy. However, smart
metering technology may involve storing consumption data locally. If
the electricity provider has access to the detailed data, this can
severely violate privacy. If the provider only has limited query access to the smart meter, then it is easier to control the privacy loss.
\christos{How can we guarantee that the provider only has limited access?}
\maryam{I remember we talked about this and you mentioned we can trust the provider but consider info leaking from price. it makes sense to me to start with this consideration.}

\section{Private mechanisms for planned consumption}
\label{sec:priv-cons-mech}
Privacy can be achieved within each period through a differentially
private mechanism. The simplest one to use is the exponential
mechanism, which works with the utility of the decision
maker. Alternative methods involve using a differentially private
version of the total planned consumption, and selecting the optimal response for this.

\subsection{The exponential mechanism.}

This would mean that, at each step $t$, we choose a price $p$ with probability
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:exponential-price}
  \Pr(p \mid \ask_t) \propto \exp(\epsilon (\price - \cost) [\demand(\price) + \fdemand_t] / \Delta),
\end{equation}
where $\Delta = 1/\elas - c$, is the sensitivity of the utility
function with respect to one customer's data changing.

\begin{lemma}
  Under bounded consumption, with $\ask_t^i \in [0,1]$, prices bounded
  in $[0,1/\elas]$ but unbounded price, a mechanism selecting prices
  according to the exponential mechanism is $\epsilon$-differentially
  private with respect to individual planned consumption at time $t$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  A single customer will change $\ask_t$ by at most $1$. This will
  alter $u$ by at most $(\price_t - c)$. As prices must be bounded in
  $[0, 1/\elas]$ and $\Delta = 1/\elas - c$, the exponent is
  $\epsilon$-Lipshitz. Hence sampling from this exponential
  distribution is $\epsilon$-DP.
\end{proof}



\paragraph{Interpretation.} In this setting, prices are a linear
function of planned consumption. Even though prices and total
consumption are necessarily bounded, the sensitivity of the utility to
one person's change remains the same, no matter how many people are in
the population.

  \caption{Figure\ref{fig:price-util} shows the effect of prices on the expected utility of the provider. Figure~\ref{fig:eps-util} shows the effect of the privacy parameter $\epsilon$ on the average price and expected utility of the provider.}
  \label{fig:utility}
\end{figure}
In Figure~\ref{fig:utility} we can see the effect of price changes on
the utility, as well as the effect of $\epsilon$ on the average price
and utility. Higher values of $\epsilon$ definitely increase our
utility, and bring the expected price level closer to the optimal. 


\subsection{The noisy sum mechanism.}

We can use the idea of a noisy sum to calculate prices. This can be efficiently implemented in a distributed manner through a tree structure that also guarantees local differential privacy to each participant. In the simplest case, we can use
\begin{align}
  \hat{\ask}_t &= \ask_t + \varepsilon_t, 
  &
    \varepsilon_t &\sim \Laplace(1/\epsilon).
\end{align}
\begin{lemma}
  With probability $1 - \delta$, our realised utility is within
  $O(\epsilon \ln (1/\delta))$ of the non-private utility. In
  addition, our expected utility is identical to that of the
  non-private utility.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  The Laplace distribution has exponential tails and so
  $\Pr(|\varepsilon_t| > k) < \exp(-k/\epsilon)$. Hence, with
  probability at least $1 - \delta$, the error in our noisy ask is
  \begin{align*}
    % \exp(-k/\epsilon) = \delta\\
    % k/\epsilon = \ln (1/\delta)\\
    k = \epsilon \ln (1/\delta).
  \end{align*}
  Since the utility is a linear function of the total ask $\ask_t$ and
  price, and the price is bounded, the first result follows. Finally,
  note that the expectation of Laplace noise is zero. Combined with
  linearity, the result follows as well.
\end{proof}

\section{Deleted scenes}
\subsection{A Cournot model.}
\label{sec:cournot-model}
In Cournot-type models, price depends on the total demand.

  
  This
dependence can be any increasing function. The consumers submit their
demand schedule, and the price structure is published. The question is
whether a given can learn anything about others' consumptions or
hidden variables (occupancy for example) based on observing the price.

Let the central utility have a quadratic loss function based on total
demand $\demand_t \defn \sum_i \demand_t^i$ of users
$i = 1, \ldots, n$, at time $t$.
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:loss}
  \loss_t(x) = \cost(\demand_t + \fdemand_t)^2/2,
\end{equation}
where $\fdemand_t$ is a fixed demand term, that must be met
independently.  Then, for a large number of players, the price
\begin{equation}
  \price_t = \cost(\demand_t + \fdemand_t),
  \label{eq:price}
\end{equation}
ensures that at the Nash equilibrium minimises $\loss_t$, and that the
individual cost is
\begin{equation}
  c_t^i = \price_t x_t^i.
  \label{eq:cost}
\end{equation}
For the sake of the argument, I will assume that our utility function is going to be
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:equilibrium-utility}
  \util(x,p) = \price \demand - \cost(\demand + \fdemand)^2/2
\end{equation}
